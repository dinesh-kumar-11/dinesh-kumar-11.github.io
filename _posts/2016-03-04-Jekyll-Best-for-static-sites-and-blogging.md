title: Jekyll - Best for static sites and blogging
---

This first post is to honor hardworking developers of Jekyll, who made my life easy in developing static website and pages.

First time building a static webstite ?

Checkout <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyllrb.com</a> for installation, setup and running.

For free themes and templates - <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org" target="_blank">jekyllthemes.org</a>.

I was able to build and get this site up and running in 15 mins. Thanks to them.
